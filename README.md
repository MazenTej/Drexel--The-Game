# To utilize "Drexel" The Game you must have Unity Hub and at least Unity 2019.
# The entire game is saved on the branch named "Caraton" due to the problems occuring with merging those files with the master branch.
# The code for the game exists in the "scripts" folder embedded in the "assets" folder of the game's files.
# The physical levels (scenes) are located in the "scenes" folder embedded in the "assets" folder of the game's files.
# If you wish to edit or modify code it is recommended to use Visual Studio (2017 or better) to do so, as that is what was utilized to create the scripts.
# The game is programmed in C# but you may also utilize Java Script to create any new features to the game.
# Current/existing features should not be modified utilizing Java Script.
# The program runs on any OS that supports Unity 2019, and can be tested though the Unity player.
# The game can also be exported as a .exe file for testing on OSs like MacOS, Windows, and Linux.
# The game should not be converted to another game editing software due to the script's dependencies on Unity components.
# The game is created in a Unity 2D project setting, but 3D objects and components are usable in the development of the game.
